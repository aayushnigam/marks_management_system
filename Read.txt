Marks Management System
Overview
The Marks Management System is a Django-based application that allows users to manage student data and their marks. The system reads data from a CSV file and provides functionality to add students and their marks.

Modules
1. index(request)
This function renders the index page of the application.

This function reads data from a CSV file for the student list and renders the 'student_list.html' page with the student list data.

3. add_student(request)
This function handles the addition of a new student. If the request method is POST and the form is valid, it saves the form data and redirects to the student list. Otherwise, it renders the 'add_student.html' page with the form and student data read from a CSV file.

4. read_csv_student_data(file_path)
